# E8: Integration & Hardening

## Goal

Verify the complete Loom workflow end-to-end with a simulated GitHub interaction,
exercise all retry-budget exhaustion paths, and ship cross-compiled release
binaries.

## Description

With all individual packages complete, E8 runs the full FSM + MCP + GitHub
client + Store stack together. Integration tests use an `httptest` server that
simulates GitHub API responses across a complete 3-phase lifecycle.

This epic also adds the release automation (git tag → CI artifact upload).

## User Stories

- [ ] US-8.1 — Integration test: simulate full 3-phase lifecycle (IDLE → COMPLETE)
- [ ] US-8.2 — Integration test: CI failure → DEBUGGING → fix → AWAITING_CI → REVIEWING → MERGING
- [ ] US-8.3 — Integration test: retry budget exhaustion → PAUSED → resume
- [ ] US-8.4 — Integration test: session stall detection → PAUSED → resume
- [ ] US-8.5 — Cross-compilation matrix verified in CI (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64)
- [ ] US-8.6 — Release workflow: `git tag v*` triggers binary upload to GitHub Releases

## Dependencies

- E2 (FSM), E3 (GitHub client), E4 (MCP server), E5 (CLI), E6 (session), E7 (checkpointing)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] US-8.1 integration test passes: machine reaches COMPLETE state in simulation
- [ ] US-8.2 integration test passes: debug loop terminates correctly
- [ ] US-8.3 integration test passes: PAUSED is reached on budget exhaustion; `loom resume` continues
- [ ] US-8.4 integration test passes: stall → PAUSED within configured timeout
- [ ] All 5 platform binaries build without errors in CI matrix
- [ ] Release workflow publishes binaries on `v*` tag push
- [ ] `go test ./... -race -cover` passes with overall coverage ≥ 80%
